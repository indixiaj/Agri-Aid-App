    We are 5 4th year engineering students looking to make the world a better place.\
    
    Consisting of Evyanne (Software Engineer), Indixia (Mechanical Engineer), Sandesh (EEE), Usman (EEE), and Abzal (EEE),
    we designed a solution to solve a major problem affecting a large population in Ethiopia. 
    The wheat plant has been a source of income and food for years and continues to be. 
    However, the wheat rust disease has been affecting communities reducing yield.

    We designed an IoT Farming System, designed specifically for the wheat plant in Ethiopia in order
    to monitor and control irrigation and nutrients.
